# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis

The database marketing or direct marketing people are always concerned about two questions before they send out mails or 
make calls to their customers:-

i) How can they segment the customers in the database to find out who are more likely to response to their mails or buy their products?
ii) Which type of customers they should send the mails to so that they can reach breakeven and make profit?

The RFM method is a very simple but effective customer analysis way to address the above questions. 
Where, R, F, and M stand for

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?
Frequency – How often do they purchase?
Monetary Value – How much do they spend (each time on average)?

Please refer to the RFM.pdf file for more details on the explanation and R code
